            <h3>Undergraduate Programmes</h3>
            <p>The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

               To qualify for admission into Computer Science programmes at Level 200, candidates must have taken the following courses at Level 100:
                
                MATH 121: Algebra and Trigonometry
                MATH 122: Calculus I CSCD 101: Introduction to Computer Science I
                CSCD 102: Introduction to Computer Science II
                Every student in the Department of Computer Science must own his or her laptop with minimum specification of:
                
                i3 64-bit Processor
                8GB RAM

            <h3>MPhil and Msc Programmes</h3>
            <p>The Department of Computer Science – University of Ghana currently runs Masters of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.

                The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a capstone project while the MPhil is a 2-year (full-time) programme. The first year of the MPhil is taught course and second year is research and dissertation. Both programmes are accelerated master’s programme specially designed to train current and future computer scientist who are available for full-time or part-time study.
                
                Students enrolled in these programmes are equipped with broader knowledge in theoretical computer science and advance technical skills to approach science in technology as a disruptive force to manage complex problems of the global society. At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on experience in solving complex, and unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance Databases, Advance Data Structures and Algorithms and Networks</p>

            <h3>PhD Programmes</h3>
            <p>Our PhD program is a full-time research program with a four-year projected duration. This program requires a high level of commitment to be completed successfully.

                Therefore, it is expected of students to live close to the university and to participate in the program full-time. Ph.D. candidates will design a customized study plan that includes a major field of specialization and at least two minor areas of specialization with advice from the postgraduate committee.
                
                The department offers frequent seminars where teachers and students discuss and evaluate current research in the subject in addition to coursework. Students are asked to participate in research activities conducted by the group and join at most one research lab in order to promote responsible critique. The department's areas of research are Cybersecurity, Networking and Communications Engineering, Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Intelligent Space and Machine Learning</p>
